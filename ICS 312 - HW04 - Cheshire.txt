Exercise #1: Overflow [32 pts]


2-byte quantities: 9210 + C123 = 5333
	yes, carry bit is set.
	yes, overflow bit is set because there's a digit added to the front of the final equation. Also, both values are negative but the answer is positive.
	It would print: 21299d
	
2-byte quantities: 2100 + 7033 = 9133
	no, carry bit is not set.
	yes, there is overflow because the result is greater than 2-bytes. Also, both values are positive, but the result is negative.
	It would print: -28365d

1-byte quantities: B5 + 25 = DA
	no, the carry bit is not set. 
	no, there is no overflow because the result is a 1-byte quantity.
	It would print: -38d

1-byte quantities: E1 + D4 = B5
	yes, the carry bit is set. 
	no, the overflow bit is not set because the result has an extra digit beyond one byte. because neg plus neg is bigger neg value
	It would print: -75d
